# Decentralized Matrix Investment Platform

## Overview

Welcome to the **Decentralized Matrix Investment Platform** â€“ an innovative investment solution built on the Binance Smart Chain. Our platform features a dynamic 2x2 matrix pool system with 8 distinct pools, allowing users to choose between token-based or USDT-based investment strategies. We leverage advanced technologies to provide a seamless and engaging experience.

## Key Features

- **2x2 Matrix Pools:** Engage with our unique 2x2 matrix system across 8 pools, designed to optimize your investment strategy.
- **Flexible Investment Options:** Choose between using custom tokens or USDT for your investments.
- **Custom USDT Token:** Our platform utilizes a custom USDT token, developed to streamline the investment process and bypass the challenges of acquiring testnet USDT.
- **Efficient Distribution:** For every $20 distributed, 45% is allocated to the referrer and parent, while 5% goes to the admin.

## Architecture

- **Frontend:** Built with React.js to offer a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend:**
  - **Main Backend:** Developed using Solidity for smart contract functionality.
  - **Custom Backend:** Implemented in Node.js to handle event data storage via webhooks.
- **Blockchain:** Operates on Binance Smart Chain for secure and efficient transactions.

## Libraries and Tools

Our project integrates a variety of libraries and tools to enhance functionality and user experience:

- **ethers.js:** For interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and managing transactions.
- **react-content-loader:** For skeleton loading animations to improve user experience during data fetching.
- **react-placeholder-loading:** Provides loading placeholders while data is being fetched.
- **react-router-dom:** Manages routing within the React application.
